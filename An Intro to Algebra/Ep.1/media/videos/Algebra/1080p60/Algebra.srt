1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,796
Everyone always says

2
00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:04,695
What is Algebra? How do I use it?

3
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:06,315
But no one asks:

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,740
Why is Algebra? What does it really mean?

5
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:14,861
Maybe you've seen some Algebra before, and wondered

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,642
why?

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,970
Why are there letters? What are these symbols?

8
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:24,718
Or even if you haven't, that's completely okay. This

9
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:28,454
series of videos will focus on the intuitions behind

10
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:31,687
Algebra, and why everything is the way it is.

11
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:36,699
Perhaps we can start from the

12
00:00:36,783 --> 00:00:38,003
actual name

13
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:41,395
Algebra actually comes from Arabic

14
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:42,751
and it means

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,174
the reunion of broken parts

16
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:50,494
It comes up when we want to find

17
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,659
the unknown.

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,322
But I think I'll just try to show you with an example:

19
00:00:56,916 --> 00:01:00,893
Imagine you go to use the bathroom, but when you come back,

20
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:05,039
you see your friend with two pencils in their hand. You look

21
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:08,840
back at your pile of pencils and you only see one left.

22
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,130
You try to think, but forget:

23
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:14,020
how many pencils did you originally have?

24
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:21,689
This sounds like a simple problem. But instead

25
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:23,885
of trying to do it in our heads,

26
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,107
let's use

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,108
Algebra

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,588
Let's use a picture of the number of pencils we had like this.

29
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:37,735
We can think of this as some number that we currently don't know:

30
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,677
It could be 1 pencil,

31
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,154
4 pencils

32
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,626
or even 1000!

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,282
Anyways, we know that our friend took 2 of them.

34
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:54,194
So that means that our number of pencils got

35
00:01:54,283 --> 00:01:56,031
subtracted by 2.

36
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,856
And lastly, we know that we saw

37
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,090
1 pencil when we got back from the bathroom.

38
00:02:02,183 --> 00:02:03,883
That's why we can say that

39
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:04,747
this

40
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:06,891
is equal

41
00:02:07,983 --> 00:02:08,915
to this.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,788
So we can write our equation like this. Overall,

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,400
the number of pencils we had was subtracted by two

44
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:21,927
represented by this minus two

45
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,853
and now, this is

46
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,418
equal to 1 pencil remaining.

47
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:30,265
Think for a moment and try to understand

48
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,538
how we converted our word problem into Algebra.

49
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:36,917
Really, try and pause the video to contemplate.

50
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:43,428
Now, I know this doesn't seem like a lot, and it really isn't.

51
00:02:44,516 --> 00:02:47,464
But the beauty with Algebra is that we can use it

52
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,922
to solve problems like this:

53
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:57,220
Lukas and Anna are siblings. Lukas is 3 years old. Anna is 16 years

54
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,504
old. How old will they be when Anna is twice as old as Lukas?

55
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:06,560
Really take a look at it, and pause the video if you want

56
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,029
to try it out yourself. If you try to guess, finding the answer

57
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:15,854
might take a long time! Yet, we can methodically and easily solve it

58
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:20,252
using algebra. Think of it as a sneak peek for what's to come.

59
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,046
Now, back to our equation, there's one

60
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:28,770
last thing I want to quickly address:

61
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:32,246
In our equation, we used a picture of a pencil to

62
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:35,654
show how many pencils we had in the first place.

63
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,941
But a little secret I'll tell you

64
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,858
right now is that mathematicians are lazy.

65
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,314
We wouldn't want to draw pictures every single time we did math,

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,348
so let's use a letter instead like this.

67
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:50,997
I think p makes the most sense,

68
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:55,951
because p can stand for pencils - the amount of pencils we had.

69
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,582
Finally, the last thing I want to touch on is the significance of

70
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,126
this equals sign.

71
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:06,912
Algebra is all about trying to put back together broken

72
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:10,087
parts, which can be hard - I mean, think about

73
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:13,124
trying to put back together a broken window!

74
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:15,252
That's why we're going to be using

75
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,506
this, as much as we can.

76
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,510
Later, we'll delve into how exactly we can do that, but I hope

77
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,312
this served as a little intro into the wonderful world of Algebra.
