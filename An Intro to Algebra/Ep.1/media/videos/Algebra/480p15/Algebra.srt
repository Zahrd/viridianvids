1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,796
Everyone always says

2
00:00:02,096 --> 00:00:04,708
What is Algebra? How do I use it?

3
00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:06,340
But no one asks:

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,780
Why is Algebra? What does it really mean?

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,908
Maybe you've seen some Algebra before, and wondered

6
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:16,700
why?

7
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:21,028
Why are there letters? What are these symbols?

8
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:24,763
Or even if you haven't, that's completely okay. This

9
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:28,499
series of videos will focus on the intuitions behind

10
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:31,732
Algebra, and why everything is the way it is.

11
00:00:34,832 --> 00:00:36,748
Perhaps we can start from the

12
00:00:36,848 --> 00:00:38,068
actual name

13
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:41,460
Algebra actually comes from Arabic

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,828
and it means

15
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:45,252
the reunion of broken parts

16
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:50,580
It comes up when we want to find

17
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,756
the unknown.

18
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:55,928
But I think I'll just try to show you with an example:

19
00:00:56,028 --> 00:01:00,005
Imagine you go to use the bathroom, but when you come back,

20
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:04,151
you see your friend with two pencils in their hand. You look

21
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:07,952
back at your pile of pencils and you only see one left.

22
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:10,232
You try to think, but forget:

23
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:13,136
how many pencils did you originally have?

24
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:20,792
This sounds like a simple problem. But instead

25
00:01:20,892 --> 00:01:22,988
of trying to do it in our heads,

26
00:01:23,088 --> 00:01:24,212
let's use

27
00:01:24,312 --> 00:01:25,220
Algebra

28
00:01:28,312 --> 00:01:32,700
Let's use a picture of the number of pencils we had like this.

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,852
We can think of this as some number that we currently don't know:

30
00:01:36,952 --> 00:01:38,796
It could be 1 pencil,

31
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:40,284
4 pencils

32
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:42,760
or even 1000!

33
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:50,416
Anyways, we know that our friend took 2 of them.

34
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:53,312
So that means that our number of pencils got

35
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,098
subtracted by 2.

36
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,890
And lastly, we know that we saw

37
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,090
1 pencil when we got back from the bathroom.

38
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,850
That's why we can say that

39
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,714
this

40
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,858
is equal

41
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,882
to this.

42
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,730
So we can write our equation like this.

43
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:18,536
Overall, the number of pencils we had was subtracted by two

44
00:02:18,617 --> 00:02:21,061
represented by this minus two

45
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:23,037
and now, this is

46
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:25,552
equal to 1 pencil remaining.

47
00:02:26,684 --> 00:02:29,416
Think for a moment and try to understand

48
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:32,672
how we converted our word problem into Algebra.

49
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,034
Really, try and pause the video to contemplate.

50
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:42,496
Now, I know this doesn't seem like a lot, and it really isn't.

51
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,498
But the beauty with Algebra is that we can use it

52
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,922
to solve problems like this:

53
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:54,721
Lukas and Anna are siblings. Lukas is 3 years old. Anna is 16 years

54
00:02:54,821 --> 00:03:00,005
old. How old will they be when Anna is twice as old as Lukas?

55
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:04,049
Really take a look at it, and pause the video if you want

56
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:08,518
to try it out yourself. If you try to guess, finding the answer

57
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:13,342
might take a long time! Yet, we can methodically and easily solve it

58
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:17,741
using algebra. Think of it as a sneak peek for what's to come.

59
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:23,538
Now, back to our equation, there's one

60
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:26,261
last thing I want to quickly address:

61
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:29,740
In our equation, we used a picture of a pencil to

62
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,149
show how many pencils we had in the first place.

63
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:35,440
But a little secret I'll tell you

64
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,357
right now is that mathematicians are lazy.

65
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:41,837
We wouldn't want to draw every single time we did math,

66
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:44,885
so let's use a letter instead like this.

67
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:47,549
I think p makes the most sense,

68
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:52,517
because p can stand for pencils - the amount of pencils we had.

69
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:57,149
Finally, the last thing I want to touch on is the significance of

70
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:58,709
this equals sign.

71
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:03,505
Algebra is all about trying to put back together broken

72
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:06,680
parts, which can be hard - I mean, think about

73
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,717
trying to put back together a broken window!

74
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,853
That's why we're going to be using

75
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:14,109
this, as much as we can.

76
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,119
Later, we'll delve into how exactly we can do that, but I hope

77
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:24,921
this served as a little intro into the wonderful world of Algebra.
